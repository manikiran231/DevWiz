# DevWiz - A Multi-Tool Utility App for Developers 🛠️

## Problem Statement 🚨

As developers, we often find ourselves switching between various tools and utilities to perform common tasks, such as formatting JSON, generating strong passwords, or testing typing speed. These small but essential tasks can be repetitive and time-consuming. Having to open multiple tools or websites for each task can disrupt our workflow and lower productivity. 

There was a need for an all-in-one platform that consolidates these useful utilities into a single, easy-to-use app, making these tools more accessible and convenient for developers, designers, and tech enthusiasts.

## Project Description 📱

DevWiz is a web-based application designed to streamline the daily tasks of developers. By combining multiple developer-focused utilities into one platform, DevWiz eliminates the need to navigate between various separate tools and websites.
